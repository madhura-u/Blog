    <p>Hate crimes around the world are affecting the human lives, communities’ close-knit relationships and individual virtues. Hate crime in India kick-started under the British rule muddling the peaceful lives of Indians through religion, faith and belief.</p>
<p>Hate crime involves thousands of people around the globe physically attacked sometimes even killed by other people due to either religion, race, nationality, faith, sexual orientation, belief, or gender identity. There are many hate crimes happening around the globe like the massacre of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, hate crimes against children, hate crimes suffered by transgender etc. The hate crimes effects not just the immediate victims but also effects people who learn about those crimes. This results in feelings of unsafety, vulnerability and anxiety among people.</p>
<p>Committing hate crimes are not uncommon in India and more number of reported crimes being against Dalits and Muslims. The sad part is that the children and minors are also the victims of hate crimes. Under the British rule, British men tagged Indian men as “unmanly” with the intention of provoking violence in our holy nation. Fooled by this, Indian men started violent practices trying to prove them wrong. Thus, the virtue of religions was ripped apart and people belonging to the same nationality started disputing and fighting among themselves. They also started persecuting women to raise their standards which is shown in one of the documentaries called “Father, son and the holy war”. Hate crime due to religion, faith and belief took roots in India. The Hate crimes fueled the arrogance of men in turn affecting women as it was a man dominant society and women were often trampled.</p>
<p> When we look closely, we realize that the British were the one who sowed the seeds of hate crime in India.  If Indian men had beat their brains out and stood by the virtues of their own religions instead of rushing to prove the British wrong, all the hate crimes that we see in the present and in the history wouldn’t have happened. It all lies in the hands of the citizens. The fate of the country is controlled by its men. Thus, it becomes so important for the citizens to have sensible and righteous views, not influenced by politics or religion. These qualities which the citizens are supposed to have are well depicted in the poem “The Unknown citizen” written by W H Auden.</p>
<p>The man in the poem neither had extensive or radical views nor had any case against him. He served his community, had a job and a family with right number of children. He was sensible and had an insight of events happening around him. Thus, he becomes the epitome of good citizenship-the ideal citizen. Thus, it can be strongly advocated that the destiny of the nation lies in the hands of its citizens.</p>
